#The Worldly Word Association Game
Final Project for Intro to Programming at Hackbright

DIRECTIONS: For each word that pops up, enter the corresponding country. Words will be anything from foods and landmarks to famous individuals and movies. The main menu will allow you to choose a level of difficulty based on how worldly you think you are. Scoring for the "easy" level will be 5 points for each correct answer, scoring for the "medium" level will go by 10s, and the "difficult" level will be 20 points for each correct answer. Happy word associating!
